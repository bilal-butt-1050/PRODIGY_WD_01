        text: `Let me start by making clear that I am a hardened sceptic and atheist. I do not subscribe to any theological doctrine or believe in ghosts, aliens or messages from beyond. I also do not believe in any form of new age spiritualism (no crystals, no spirit healing, no entities watching over us). But there is this one incident I can not explain. My story takes place in the mid 1970s in a city in Germany. I was about 7 or 8 years old at the time. The house we were living in had an upstairs and a downstairs apartment. My family occupied the upper apartment and a middle aged couple lived downstairs. They made a bit of extra money by providing daycare for various children, but they never cared for more than one child at a time. I usually befriended those kids and was quite used to them not coming any more, because their parents´ schedules had changed or they had moved or whatever. Then there was this one girl I especially connected with. I have since forgotten her name, but I am sure it started with an R, so let´s call her Regina. I still remember that she was one or two years older than me and had light curly hair. I thought she was beautiful. 

                         So, one day I was playing a kid´s version of Badminton with my mother on the big lawn right in front of our house.It must have been a weekend, because it was around noon and I was not in school.We were passing the ball back and forth, when I saw Regina standing in the doorway.I was not the least bit surprised to see her and called out to her, something like”Hey Regina, wanna join us?”.She answered: “I am going away, Ron.Goodbye” (in German, of course).She looked absolutely normal to me and was wearing regular 70s clothing(if there is such a thing). But one thing struck me immediately: She was not smiling, but was very, very serious.Also, her voice was somehow flat.She then started calmly walking away from our house across the lawn and passed right between me and my mother.My mother then asked: “Who are you talking to ?” and I said “Regina, you must have seen her! ?”. When I turned my head to look for the girl, who should have still been on the lawn, she had vanished.  

                          One day later my father called me into his study because he had something to tell me.Regina had died in the downstairs apartment.She had played with a tape recorder that had a faulty power cord and was electrocuted.My father said that he was so sorry, but also glad that I did not have to witness the ambulance and police arriving as I was in school.I then asked “But when did this happen ?”. Turns out, it happened the day before I saw her leaving the house. 

                        The obvious answer to this is that I must have overheard my parents talking and my subconsciousness made the encounter up.I tell you, that is not true.Seeing Regina felt totally natural to me at first.And there is one more thing: Decades later I was talking to my mother(a very rational woman) about this and she revealed to me that my parents had planned to not tell me about the death at all.Remember: I was very much used to the kids from downstairs not showing up anymore and my parents just wanted to leave it at that.My mother is adamant that they did not discuss the matter.They only told me, because my mother had heard me talking to Regina. 

                         I am now a 48 year old man and I have never encountered any other supernatural event in my life.When my beloved grandparents died and my adored father passed away much later, I was actively looking for signs.Although I had felt a connection to the girl, my emotional connection to my family had of course been much greater.But nothing ever happened. 

                         My memory of that day is still very clear and I have not embellished the story in any way.And all these years later, I still ask myself: Where did Regina go ?`,

        text: `Yes, it is quite common for people to call them hallucinations, but it was not one in my case. I will try to describe it as accurately as possible.

                        So, little students of grade 1 to 8 used to come to my house to study and my elder sister used to teach them. They children would come at around 3:00 pm and leave around 7:30 pm (it was summer). Since it was summer it was close being dark but not fully dark at 7:30 pm.

                        Now, one of the kids started doing this weird thing. He/she would hide the smaller shoes in the bigger shoes of the students and when it came time for students to leave, they would be searching all around for their shoes. This started happening quite often. Every day there was one student complaining about lost shoes. And then we would find them in some bigger shoes.

                        On this particular evening, it happened again. It was around 7:30 pm when one of the students started complaining about lost shoes. My little brother, who happens to be taller and bulkier than me and was that way at that time too, got up and started searching for the shoes. While searching for the shoes, he was mumbling in anger about whoever kept repeating this silly joke of hiding the shoes every day. Now, I need to explain a bit about how the area where the kids used to leave their shoes looked like.

                        We were on the first floor. So, you would climb up the stairs from the ground floor on these spiraling stairs. The whole area with the stairs was like separated from the house in a way that when you reached the first floor, there was a door you had to open to get inside the house. And from this door, these stairs would lead you to the second floor. So, if you stood at the door that entered our house on the first floor, you will see the stairs going down to the ground floor and stairs going up to the second floors. If you close the door, you are inside the house on the first floor and the whole stair region is outside, completely separated.

                        So, my little brother is looking for the shoes but for some reason, they could not find the shoes anywhere, even inside the bigger ones. My brother decides to go upstairs on the second floor to see if someone had thrown them there. I am like inside the house and laughing at my brother’s constant mumbling and complaining. So, he’s going upstairs and constantly talking back to the kids and saying thing like, “Hey kids, if someone has done it, please speak up where you have hidden the shoes.” All of sudden he screams from upstairs. I can’t describe the sound of that scream believe me. It was horrifying. And as I run to that staircase portion, I see him coming downstairs from the second floor skipping 3 stairs with every stride. He runs past me and into the house. I go after him and he just drops on the bed. While lying like a dead body on the floor staring up at the ceiling, he is like, “There’s someone, there’s someone, there, there, some, ,some” He could not even complete his sentence.

                        I thought he must have encountered some thief or robber upstairs so I pick up a bending rod in my hands. I don’t know what to call this thing but this was a some rod like thing that people bend with both their hands to exercise. I pick it up in my right hand and slowly start walking upstairs on the spiraling stairs. As I am walking upstairs, my brother starts shouting from inside the house, “Majid, don’t go there, there is something over there come down.”

                        At this point I reach the end of the spiraling stairs onto the second floor into a store room. Yes, I know it’s a weird structure of the house but this is what it was. The stairs ended in a small store room kind of structure with a door opening to the open-air rooftop. Just when I reach that store room kind of area, which is still a closed and roofed area, I smell some scent in the air. It was very intense and loud believe me. I was like what the hell is that smell? And now my mind starts to find reasons to justify that scent. I am like, maybe there was some perfume in the store room that has spilled. But I looked around (it was a very small space so exploring the whole thing wasn’t a task) but couldn’t find a thing. In my head I am like, “maybe someone came from the roof and stood here and they were wearing this perfume”. To my surprise, I look at the gate/door that opens to the open-air roof and it’s locked form the inside i.e. the door knob was locked from the inside. There was no way someone could have gone out and locked it—it was like physically impossible. The last thought in my head was, “It must be some smell outside in the air that has come inside from the gap underneath the door.” But the problem was, the scent was now slowly fading away and when opened the door and went on to the roof, there was no such smell. In fact, I could smell someone in the neighbor cooking food.

                        In the mean time, the scent in the air is completely gone. I go downstairs and there is my little brother on the bed and telling my mother what he saw. That’s how he described it.

                        “ I was going upstairs looking for the shoes. As I went close to the store room area, I felt it was getting dark (keep in mind it was now around 7:40 pm at that time so the night was falling) so I tried to turn on the lights from the switchboard located in one corner. As I approached the switchboard to turn on the lights I spotted a lady wearing an orange colored shawl standing with her back to the wall and staring right at my face. And as I was about to approach the switchboard and had already extended my arm, she moved to one side while keeping her back to the wall. After that I screamed and started running downstairs. I don’t even know how I have come downstairs and what was moving me but I just started running madly”

                        At this moment I thought it wasn’t a good idea to tell him that when I had gone to that store room area a few minutes ago, I had felt a pull in my body at exactly the location where he was saying he saw this lady. When I was there, I could constantly feel something pulling my soul out of me. And that weird scent in that exact spot. Anyway, I kept my calm and helped my brother get back to his senses. He had fever that night and he constantly kept saying, “Please recite something, please don’t leave my side etc.”

                        But do you know what the most shocking part of the story was?

                        When children came to our house for the tuition the next day, one of the kids who was present at that time when all of this happened started talking about the whole incident. And there was this guy aged around 13 or 14, he called my sister (his teacher) and said this.

                        “Ma’am, did your brother see a little chubby lady wearing an orange shawl with very big eyes?”

                        And my sister was like whattttttttt???? Yes, that’s the exact person my brother had described. And these are the words he said after that.

                        “You see, this is why I always try to leave your house before it gets dark because a couple of times when I had gotten late and I saw this same lady coming downstairs from your second floor. She just comes downstairs and while going downstairs to the ground floor, she just disappears.”

                        We were all like, :o :o :o

                        There is a lot more to tell in this incident but it has already become very lengthy, so yeah that’s it.`,

        text: `I never met my father-in-law. He passed before I met my husband. Paul.

                        Paul and I were having a hard time, and he said he wanted a divorce. I agreed. That night his father Frank visited me in a dream and begged me to not leave his son. He said Paul needed me and I needed him.

                        I decided it was just a dream and ignored it.

                        The next day at work I got a call from my husband’s boss. Paul had a heart attack and was going to the hospital. I got in my car and sped off. Frank appeared in my car and told me to say out loud that I loved my husband and he would live.

                        I ignored him.

                        At the hospital I watched as Paul died twice and was shocked back to life each time. Then they wheeled him away to the cath lab.

                        I was sent to a private waiting room, and I knew they did not expect my husband to make it. I could see Frank looking at me sadly, but he would not talk to me. I began crying and said “Please live, my darling husband. I need you. I love you.”

                        After a couple of hours the doctor came in and told me that he had inserted several stents, but my husband’s health was iffy. He had died once more in the cath lab, but they brought him back.

                        Paul was wheeled to Cardiac ICU. I sat by him and told him I loved him.

                        He made it through the night, and the next night and the next night. Our marriage has been very happy for the past seven years since that time. Frank peeks in from time to time, but keeps quiet.`,

        text: `I have been going to therapy for quite some time. At this point, I’d been with my current therapist for maybe 2 years. I was making progress and was really impressed with how much she’d been able to help me.

                        She had two young kids who would come to her office on days when there was no school. There was a playroom set up across from her office. Usually, a nanny would accompany the kids. There was never any disruption to our sessions even though the children were young. I was almost as impressed by that as I was by her obvious skills.

                        This day, she came in with her two kids and started upstairs. A much older woman was between her and her kids. I thought she must have gotten a new nanny. She told me to come up and we settled in for our session except I had an overwhelming feeling of sadness. I asked her if she was ok. She told me she was but, of course, she would say that because she had boundaries. I was looking past her at the closet with a dark wooden door when the strangest thing happened. The older woman I had seen behind her kids sort of materialized in the wood grain and then stepped forward behind my therapist. She put her hand on her shoulder.

                        I asked again if my therapist was ok. She assured me she was. Then the older woman seemed to notice me. She spoke. “Tell her I’m ok.” I pretended I didn’t hear her. She said louder, TELL HER I’M OK.” This time I said, “No.” This was all happening not out loud but telepathically. It’s very hard to explain. It’s sort of like having your head and your heart working simultaneously.

                        I didn’t want to tell her that her dead mother was standing behind her asking me to give her a really bland message from the beyond. I might have been willing to take a chance had she said, “Tell her about the time when she was 5 and we went to the beach and had a fish boil” or anything that wasn’t so mundane as “I’m ok.” So I asked my therapist one more time and with greater urgency, “Are you sure you’re ok?” This time she said, “Well, I just found out before I came to work that someone close to me died.” I thought, “Yeah, no kidding.” I told her I was sorry and we certainly didn’t need to finish the session since I also knew it was her mother and she probably needed to make all sorts of arrangements. Meanwhile, her mother continued to ‘talk’ to me.

                        Here’s the thing, this is my therapist, not a friend. I didn’t really want to tell her I was seeing things. I also didn’t want to pass on messages from the beyond because it seemed like a really big boundary problem. I left and she told me she’d be gone for several weeks. In the ensuing weeks I was obsessing about the ‘message’ from her mother. Keep in mind, my therapist never told me who had died. When she came back to work, I screwed up my courage and told her what had happened. I described what the woman looked like, what she was wearing and what she said. I told her I knew it was a pretty bland message but I had to tell her because I couldn’t quit hearing it and I had to say it out loud to her.

                        She looked absolutely astonished. She told me that when her father passed, her mother would say, “I just wish I knew he was ok.” It had become something she obsessed about over the years. The message, “I’m ok,” meant a lot to her and her siblings. Go figure.`,
